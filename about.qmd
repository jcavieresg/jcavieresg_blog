I am a postdoctoral researcher in the "[Chair of Spatial Data Science and Statistical Learning](https://uni-goettingen.de/en/629104.html)" at **Georg-August-Universität Göttingen**. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the "[Chair of Geoinformatics-Big Spatial Data](https://www.geoinformatics.uni-bayreuth.de/en/)" at **Bayreuth University**. I earned a doctoral degree in Statistics from **Universidad de Valparaíso** in 2022 and a Master in Statistics (2016) in the same University.

Originally I am from **Puente Alto**, Santiago of Chile, but most of my life was in the beautiful **Valparaíso**. ​However (sorry to the former two), my favorite place in the world is **Los Vilos**!
