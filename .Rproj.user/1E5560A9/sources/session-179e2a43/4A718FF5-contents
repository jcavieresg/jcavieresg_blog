I am a postdoctoral researcher in the "Chair of Spatial Data Science and Statistical Learning" at **Georg-August-Universität Göttingen**. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the "Chair of Geoinformatics-Big Spatial Data" at **Bayreuth University**. I earned a doctoral degree in Statistics from **Universidad de Valparaíso** in 2022 and a Master in Statistics in the same University

Originally I am from **Puente Alto**, Santiago of Chile, but most of my life was in the beautiful **Valparaíso**. ​However (sorry to the former two), my favorite place in the world is Los Vilos!
